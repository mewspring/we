This package specifies commonly used types and constants for window events. It is heavily inspired by [glfw](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/) and [go.wde](https://github.com/skelterjohn/go.wde/).

The goal is to make window event handling interoperate well between various packages, even though this may be a [self-defeating purpose](https://xkcd.com/927/).
